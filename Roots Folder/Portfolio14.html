                <td> This Design was made as a fun competition for my digital Illustration class. The task was to create a Yeti banner that the class would vote on and the winner would be used as the background for our class's canvas bulletin board. I had some trouble coming up with a realistic design for the yeti and after many different sketches I decided to go with a more cartoonish look to it.  Instead of forcing a realistic design I decided to create a fun little cartoon. I thought it would be a cute idea for a hot chocolate hot tub and I added little marshmallows and a little cabin.
