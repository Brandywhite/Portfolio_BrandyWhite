			<td> In my typography class I was tasked with creating a silhouette of an object using just words. There were only supposed to be a total of three colors so I made sure to use it sparingly and make sure that they would stand out. I used a yellow happy on the head to show as a happy person and a red compassionate to show a compassionate heart. Each would have a different size and different fonts with the most important ones being the largest to attract the eyes. </td>
