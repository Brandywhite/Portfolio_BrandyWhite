			<td>TThis poster was the second of a three part series to create anthropomorphic animals for Safari days at the San Diego Zoo. For this design I wanted to create more of a cool guy look, so I decided to go with a cheetah for the animal and give him more of a hipster explorer look. It was very difficult to create a human-like expression for the cheetah so I decided to add some glasses and use his "smile" as the facial expression. If I was to redo the poster I would definitely move the text to make it look like it isn't all crowded at the edge of the poster.  </td>
