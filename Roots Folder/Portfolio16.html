               <td> This book cover was made as an assignment for my digital arts class. We were instructed to read the book and design a cover based on what we read. I loved the book Night Circus and it was really hard to pick just one scene so I made the decision to use the icons to show some of the most important symbols of the book including the tarot card reading and the different important items for each of the main characters. </td>
