              <td>  For my digital arts class we made different covers for our favorite I made this as a secondary cover for the Bad Bunny album YHLQMDLG.The whole album was about how he does what he wants and the original is a small child riding a bike trying to outrun aliens. I decided to focus on the alien idea as well as add in a sort of evil eye situation to it. I had a bit of trouble adding the glitching effect to the entire cover but I was able to work on it after a while. </td>
