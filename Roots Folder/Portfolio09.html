           <td> This is a poster with a view of a future space station called station x. This also features a framed style with the silhouette of two small children looking out. Finding a way to show the features of the children looking shocked as they stare out and see the colony was tricky. Although I knew I didn't want the children to be the primary focus, I had to give them an appropriate reaction to seeing out in space for the first time. I settled on just the silhouette and to make the window the frame.</td>
