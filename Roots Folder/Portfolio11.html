            <td>  For this poster the theme was to create an anthropomorphic animals poster for Safari days at the San Diego Zoo. Using only found images, I had to blend the different images together to make it look like it had been photographed. It was one of the first assignments I had ever created so it was very difficult to learn how to cut, layer and blend so it would look natural. The collar was possibly the hardest part as I had to fix the fur on the monkey's neck to make it look as if the shirt was sitting correctly on him.   </td>
