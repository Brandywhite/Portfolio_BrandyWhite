        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My Name is Brandy White, I am currently attending the University of West Florida and majoring in Graphic Design. Before going
        to West Florida, I worked in California at an electrical Engineering Firm doing Lighting for some Major Airlines. I have my Certification in AutoCAD Drafting and Inventor, this has helped me with learning to create three Dimensional designs. I was the lead on different projects and orchestrated some big renovations with the help of senior staff. Along with learning those applications I have also learned to work with different Adobe Applications, including, After Effect, Dreamweaver photoshop and many more. In my course work I have also gotten to work with different mediums such as painting, sculpting and Charcoal sketching. More Recently I have worked with a start up to create logos and business cards, as well as working with a new on-profit orginization.</p>
